* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Complete takeover of the system with `SYSTEM` privileges.
* **Wormable Capability:** The flaw allows malware to automatically spread from one computer to another on a local network without human interaction.
* **Historical Examples:** This vulnerability was the main vector for the global cyberattacks **WannaCry** and **NotPetya** in 2017.

## 5. Mitigations and Fixes
Several measures can help protect against this threat:

* **Update (Patch):** Install the Microsoft security patch **MS17-010**, released in March 2017.
